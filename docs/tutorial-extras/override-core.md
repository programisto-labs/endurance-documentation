# Override Core

Feel free to override any library by editing the main application file to customize Endurance behavior.

If you need to create a new library file or extend Endurance functionality, you can also contribute to Endurance :)

## Extending Endurance

You can extend Endurance classes and functionality by:

1. **Extending Classes**: Create your own classes that extend `EnduranceRouter`, `EnduranceSchema`, `EnduranceAuth`, etc.
2. **Custom Middleware**: Add custom Express middleware to your application
3. **Custom Utilities**: Create utility modules that work alongside Endurance

## Contributing

If you've created useful extensions or improvements, consider contributing them back to the Endurance project on GitHub.
